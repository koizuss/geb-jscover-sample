[JSCover](http://tntim96.github.com/JSCover) - A JavaScript code coverage measurement tool.
================================

JSCover is an easy-to-use JavaScript code coverage measuring tool. It is an enhanced version of the popular
[JSCoverage](http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/), having added several features including **branch coverage** and
**LCOV** reports.
It's big distinguishing factor from other JavaScript coverage tools is that it easily runs
in any browser (supporting JavaScript) allowing coverage measurement of tests that include DOM interaction.
It can be run with most tools (e.g.
[Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/),
[QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/), etc...).

Development
-----------

Before checking-out,
[make sure your git client has "Auto CrLf convert" turned off]
(https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings).
If not, this will cause some tests to fail on Windows machine (the tests may be altered to over-come this if it
proves to be a common problem).

Development with JSCover is simple. It is a fairly standard Ant and Java build.
Most development has been done with IntelliJ community edition, and some with Eclipse.
Project files for both IDEs are checked in, but any editor can be used.
Before checking in any changes, be sure to run the build files `pre-commit`.
NB: `pre-commit` runs the report and enforces coverage limits on unit and integration tests.
Acceptance test coverage is collected and can be viewed by running the `coverage-report`
target manually after `pre-commit`.

To save repository space, the acceptance test framework HTMLUnit is not checked in.
Download HTML Unit (2.12) and unzip it to the same parent directory as JSCover to match
the build property `html.unit.dir=${basedir}/../htmlunit-2.12`.
If this property needs changing, the IntelliJ and Eclipse project files will also need altering.
